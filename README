Hi there! Here’s a list of things you might want to know:

1) How to export photos from the Photos app with GPS data included?
File -> Export -> Export photo/s. Tick ‘Location Information’. Make the JPEG quality ‘low’ and size ‘small’ especially when you’re exporting a massive amount of photos. Finally, click ‘Export’.

2) How to save data to a CSV file?
Install exiftool then run this in Terminal:
exiftool -csv -r -filename -gps:GPSLatitude -gps:GPSLongitude -createdate -imagedescription -imageheight -imagewidth [file location] > \[filename.csv]
*Change the values inside []

3) How to convert latitude and longitude values (degrees, minutes, seconds) into decimal values?
I’ve uploaded the script on my GitHub account.

4) Why can’t I access your gps data?
I didn’t upload it due to privacy concerns. I did however included gpstestdata.csv here for you to experiment on.

5) What are the ‘abs’ in comments for?
Abs means ‘abstract’. I used these lines of code to create the art pieces I wanted. I did a bit of tweaking though to get the look I’m aiming for.

6) Which tool did you use to create the map?
Tile Mill https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/
